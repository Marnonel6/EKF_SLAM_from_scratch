The start_robot.launch.xml
    - Takes arguments that are not part of the specification for the launchfile
    - While this is not so bad especially because it is documented, what is bad is that the launchfile does not work with the default arguments
     - The arguments body_id, odom_id, left_wheel_joint, right_wheel_joint are not necessary and should not be in this launchfile
